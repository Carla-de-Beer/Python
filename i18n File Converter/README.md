# i18n File Converter

Python program that reads in an 18n.properties file and converts an i18n.properties file to a CSV file, preserving UTF-8 encoding and allows for comma-inclusion as part of the text.

To ensure that special charaters are correctly displayed inside Excel, with the correct UTF-8 encoding, do the following:
* Open Excel.
* Import the file using UTF-encoding.
* Set commas as delimiters.
